# JsonParser (still in development)

JsonParser is a lightweight JSON parser library designed for simplicity and ease of use.

## TO-DO list:

- Implement the ability to save parsed JSON data as a JSON file.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure robust parsing of various JSON file formats, including files with different indent levels, empty JSON files, etc.
- Optimize the library for performance and memory usage. Identify and fix any memory leaks and redundant code to ensure efficient operation.
- Package the project and write the documentation.

In the future, feel free to contribute to the development of JsonParser by submitting pull requests, reporting bugs, or suggesting new features!
